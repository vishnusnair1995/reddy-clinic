The Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is a powerful tool for dynamically querying and manipulating
 object graphs at runtime in a Spring application. It is widely used in configurations like
  @PreAuthorize to enforce dynamic role-based access control, referencing constants, and more.

What does T(...) mean in SpEL?
The T operator in SpEL allows you to access types (classes) to reference their static methods, fields, or
 constants. For example:

java
Copy code
@PreAuthorize("hasRole(T(com.reddyclinic.doctorportal.config.RoleConstants).ROLE_ADMIN)")
T(...): Refers to the RoleConstants class at runtime.
.ROLE_ADMIN: Accesses the ROLE_ADMIN constant defined in the RoleConstants class.
Usage in hasRole: This dynamically checks if the currently authenticated user has the role "ROLE_ADMIN".
